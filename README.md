# Automatic Blinds Controller

Ardunio code to control custom rig for my mini blinds.

You can find the printed parts over on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:437031)

## Intro

My goal was to automatically open and close my office blinds in sync with daylight outside.  I was inspired by a design on thingiverse and decided to make my own controller.
I wanted to be as compact as possible which meant eliminating the control rod for the blinds.  I built a rig that attached directly to the blinds base with a minimal profile.

The design is powered by an ardunio nano powered by wall USB and triggered by a light sensor taped to the window behind the blinds.

I intended to minimize the design further with a custom board and 3D enclosure, but my reality is that this has operated flawlessly for 6 months and has been hidded behind curtains.
